### Hi, I'm Ragini! 👋
👀 I’m interested in  Data Science
🎓 I'm a final-year Data Science student with a passion for solving real-world problems using data and technology. My interests lie in **Data Analytics**, and **web scraping**,**machine learning**.

💼 I've completed internships where I worked on a variety of projects, including **car sales prediction**, **iris flower classification**, **stock price prediction**, and **speech emotion recognition**. I also have hands-on experience with **data visualization** using **Tableau** and **Python**.

📊 I recently completed a project on **web scraping car details** from Cars24.com and am currently exploring ways to combine my knowledge of **data science** with the **medical field** through research.

- **Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
